You are shown four labeled images: A, B, C, and D. Three of these images follow the same visual pattern or rule based on relationships between shapes, colors, sizes, or positions. One image does not follow the same rule — it is the odd one out.

Your task is to:
- Identify the odd image by its letter (A, B, C, or D).
- Explain briefly why it does not follow the same pattern as the other three.

Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.

You are given four labeled images (A–D). Your goal is to compare them and determine which one differs in terms of visual composition. This may involve differences in spatial arrangement, object relationships, colors, shapes, or other clearly visible features.

Respond with:
- The letter of the image that does not match the visual pattern of the others.
- A short explanation based only on what you can observe.

Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.

You are provided with four images labeled A, B, C, and D. Three images follow a consistent visual rule or structure. One image violates that rule.

Choose the image that breaks the rule (A–D) and explain why it differs. 

Base your reasoning only on the observable features in the images.

You are shown four labeled images: A, B, C, and D. Three of them follow the same visual pattern or relational structure, while one does not.

Your task is to analyze the images and select the image that doesn't fit.

Base your reasoning on visual elements such as shape, size, color, position, or relationships between objects. 

Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.
