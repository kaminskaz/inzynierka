You are given descriptions of six pairs of corresponding images, labeled 0–5:
- 0: top-left pair
- 1: top-right pair
- 2: middle-left pair
- 3: middle-right pair
- 4: bottom-left pair
- 5: bottom-right pair
Each description explains the differences between the two images in the corresponding pair.

Your task is to:
- Compare the left and right sides of the panel based on the descriptions.
- Infer the underlying concept or rule that separates the two sides.
- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Briefly explain how each side conforms (or does not conform) to the inferred rule.

Only use information provided in the image descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.
