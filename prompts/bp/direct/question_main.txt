Your task is to:
- Compare the two groups of images and infer the underlying concept or rule that separates them
- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Explain briefly how each group conforms (or does not conform) to it.

Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.
