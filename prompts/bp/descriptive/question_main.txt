Your task is to:
- Compare the two groups of images and infer the underlying concept or rule that separates them.
- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Explain briefly how each group conforms (or does not conform) to it.

Only use information provided in the image descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.

Image descriptions labeled 0–5 correspond to the left panel, and 6–11 correspond to the right panel.
