You are given descriptions of all possible sets of three images selected from four images in an odd-one-out problem.

Your task is to:
- Identify the set that does not contain an odd-one-out image by its letter (A, B, C, or D) .
- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Explain briefly why it does not follow the same pattern as the other three.

Only use information provided in the image descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.
