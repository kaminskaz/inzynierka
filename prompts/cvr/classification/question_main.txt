You are presented wit descriptions of four possible sets of images. 
Your task is to:
- dentify the set (A, B, C, or D) in which all images follow the described idea and none is an odd one out.
- Explain briefly why it does not follow the same pattern as the other three.

Only use information provided in the image descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.
