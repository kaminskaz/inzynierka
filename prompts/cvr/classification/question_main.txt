You are presented with four possible sets of images. 
Your task is to:
- Identify the set (A, B, C, or D) in which all images follow the described idea of an odd one out problem.
- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Explain briefly why it does not follow the same pattern as the other three.

Only use information provided in the images. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.
