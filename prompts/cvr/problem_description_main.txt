This puzzle is an odd one out problem. It tests the ability to identify which element doesn’t fit a shared visual rule. Most items follow the same pattern or relationship (in shape, color, size, position, etc.), while one item violates that rule. 
The task is to infer the underlying pattern and find the element that breaks it.
