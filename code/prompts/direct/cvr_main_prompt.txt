You are shown four labeled images: A, B, C, and D.
Three of these images share a consistent visual structure or pattern. One does not.

Your task is to:
- Select the image that does not match the shared rule or pattern.
- Describe clearly why it differs, based only on observable features such as shapes, colors, sizes, positions, or spatial relationships.

Stick to what is directly visible. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown.
